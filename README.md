## Introduction

The ABC Consumer Data Warehouse project is designed to consolidate and analyze data from various sources related to ABC Consumer. The data warehouse will provide a unified view of the data, enabling users to easily extract insights and make informed business decisions. The project utilizes Pig and Hive for data processing and querying, along with SQL for data manipulation and analysis.


## Technologies Used

The ABC Consumer Data Warehouse project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Hadoop:** A distributed processing framework for handling large datasets across clusters.
- **Pig:** A high-level platform for analyzing large datasets in Hadoop using a scripting language called Pig Latin.
- **Hive:** A data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop that provides a high-level language (HiveQL) for querying and managing data.
- **SQL:** Structured Query Language for managing and manipulating relational databases.
- **Git/GitHub:** Version control system and online hosting platform for collaborative development.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the ABC Consumer Data Warehouse project, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure Hadoop cluster.
2. Install and configure Pig and Hive on the Hadoop cluster.
 

4. Configure the necessary connection settings for Pig and Hive, such as Hadoop cluster address, username, and password, in the script files.
